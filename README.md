# Chocolate Bar Ratings Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that analyses ratings of chocolate bars. The analysis explores factors such as origins, companies, and other characteristics influencing the quality and ratings of chocolate

## Business Understanding
The goal of this project was to create a machine learning model to predict the rating a chocolate bar would receive on the Flavors of Cacao website. To assist with the development of the machine learning model univariate and multivariate exploratory data analysis (EDA) was carried out. This dataset was chosen as a group due to mutual interest. Challenges with the dataset included the subjective nature of the reviewing system and lack of features having an impact on the rating a chocolate bar received. 

## Data Understanding

The Chocolate Bar Ratings dataset was downloaded from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rtatman/chocolate-bar-ratings), the data comes from the Flavors of Cacao website (https://flavorsofcacao.com/index.html). Future enhancements would be to use more recent data from the Flavors of Cacao website which includes more features than the dataset on Kaggle.
